# Instructions  

---

Create a new React component named `Welcome`. This 
component should say "Welcome Jimbo!" inside
of an `<h2>` tag.
Under that, it should say "It looks like you're 
72 years old." inside of a `<p>` tag. 
When passing in values as
props for your component, make sure to use
the `name` and `age` variables provided
in the App.

Remember to import and export your component!
